# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
As a final-year computer science student, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming, algorithm design, and software development, and I am excited to showcase my portfolio, which reflects the diverse projects and experiences that have shaped my growth as a software engineer and data scientist.

# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
## UFC Stats and Visualisations
The UFC has their own official stat website for all fights they've had which can be found [here](http://www.ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed). While the data is comprehensive, the data visualisations are rather basic and don't show much data. This can prevent UFC fans from getting a better understanding of a fight, specifically the breakdown of the type of strikes landed and where they landed. A tool that creates better and more detailed visualisations would be beneficial to fans and possibly fighters too. Having this data could also help to find any trends and possibly even make predictions based on the number of strikes landed and where they are being landed.

### Data set:
The following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata) has a kaggle dataset that contains comprehensive data on all UFC fights from 1993 to 2021 which has been scraped from the official UFC stats [page](http://www.ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed).

### Technologies to use:
-   Python
-   JupyterNotebooks
-   Anaconda

### Opportunities & Challenge
This project would provide the opportunity to work with a large dataset and be able to find statistics. Certain stats can be difficult to calculate for UFC fights or fighters. It would be a great learning experience for trying to extract data and create visualisations with the data. Trying to represent complex data in a clear and concise visual can be a struggle at times.

Likewise, when calculating certain metrics such as who is able to take the most strikes to the face, some data has to be ignored such as fighters with very few fights in the UFC and this will outline some of the challenges of data science in terms of isolating valid data. When creating models for making predictions this would also be important as some fight/fight data could skew model results due to certain fighters not having enough fight data and this would also be a learning opportunity to understand how to decide what data to include when creating models for prediction.

## Decision Trees & Random Forests JupyterNotebook
The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/) is a book that introduces core concepts for doing data science work with Python. This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master) was taken and amended to work and compile on a newer version of Python (3.11). 

### Technologies to use:
-   Python
-   JupyterNotebooks
-   MatPlotLib
-   NumPy

### Opportunities & Challenge
As stated above, the Jupyter Notebook was written in an old version of Python and so a number of changes had to be made in order for it to run on the current version of Python. Also, by using the notebook, it gave me the opportunity to be able to play and experiment with pre-existing code and data.

# Software Development Projects
Below are some of my software development projects I have worked on during my studies.

## Insurance GUI Project
This project was done during my PLC course where the goal of the project was to create a GUI program for an insurance broker to enter details of a customer and calculate the cost of an insurance quote for them. This was a team project. The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/DinnyCode/Health-Insurance-GUI).

### Technologies used:
-   Java
-   Java Swing

## POS Management GUI
This was a college project done during the second year of my course. It involved creating a GUI system for POS management system for an online store. The goal was to create a system that could handle sales and refunds of store products but also manage system administration tasks such as adding new employees and stock items. The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/DinnyCode/CA-3-OOSD).

### Technologies used:
-   Java
-   Java Swing 
-   MySQL

## Assembly Game
This was a college project done during the second year of my course that involved creating a game in assembly with the theme of reducing carbon emissions in the world. With this project, I decided to create a turn-based game where a player has limited resources to purchase structures that would reduce global carbon emissions in the world and had a finite amount of turns to reduce carbon levels before it is too late. The GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/DinnyCode/AssemblyGameProject).
